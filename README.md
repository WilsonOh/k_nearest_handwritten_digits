# A simple program that takes in a handwritten (using a mouse) digit as user input and outputs its guess of that digit

## Dependencies
- python3
- numpy
- pygame

## How to use
1. git clone the repo
2. run the drawing.py file with python
>> *The program will take a few seconds to load as it is reading in the training samples*
4. Draw any digit in the window provided
5. Press the **ENTER** key to submit the digit or **ESC** to reset the canvas 
6. The program will print its guess to the console 

## Disclaimer 
- The algorithm used is a very naive implementation of the K nearest neighbours algorithm,
  making it fairly inaccurate. 
- Training samples are from the MNIST handwritten digit dataset (60,000 training samples)
